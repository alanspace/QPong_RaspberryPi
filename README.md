# QPong_RaspberryPi
QPong is a quantum game, which can teach student to learn quantum circuit. 

## Description
Quantum computer operating in superconducting qubits can go to the temperature of nearly absolute 0 degree Kelvin. It takes a huge operating cost to build and maintain its superpower. Unless you are a scientist or an engineer in an advacned reseach group or a big company like IBM, Google, Microsoft, you cannot have a taste of what it’s going on physically. It would be wonderful if you could run it on your hands. Have you ever thought having a simulated quantum computer to play the most weried game in world? Here is tutorial to make one. Let’s turn a Retro Pi into a quantum computer to play PICO-8 game.


For this project, I am responsible for the software part to install PICO-8 to Raspberry Pi by running Retro Pie image. Another Qiskit Advocate Dr. Data Ng is responsible for building the arcade to play the quantum QPong physically.

We should have showcased the quanutm real at the Cypberport exhibition called Digital Entertainmnet Leadership Forum (DELF) from 11/12 to 12/12. However, due to the widespread of Coronavirus, the exhibition may be postponed to 2021.

Details of the exhibtion can be found here: https://delf.cyberport.hk/en/index

The game was originally designed by Junye Huang, it is then further developed in Taiwan Qiskit Hackathon.
